In&nbsp;this paper we took a broader view of housing dispute resolution.&nbsp;The starting point was the problems that people encounter with housing, and how they can be best resolved. This fits in with the policy of the Ministry of Justice (the then Department for Constitutional Affairs) on the need for more user-focused services (see below).&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The issues paper set out our proposals for a more coherent system of housing dispute resolution comprising:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>use of a \"triage plus\" process, diagnosing individual and wider housing problems, referring them to appropriate resolution methods, and collecting information about housing problems and how they are resolved\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>use of dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation, ombudsmen and managerial techniques, and\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>where needed, use of a court or tribunal.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The values underpinning such a system should be stated explicitly.

Rather,&nbsp;we examined ways in which the existing law could be made more effective. There&nbsp;was a great deal of law that applied to the sector, but much of it did not work as Parliament intended. As a result, the standards set by the law were often not met, particularly in relation to the physical condition of housing. In turn, these failures contributed to the sector suffering from a poor reputation which, arguably, was getting in the way of it playing as full a part as it should in providing housing.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              The project\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              On 14 August 2008 we published our final proposals on better regulation of the private rented sector in the report Housing: Encouraging Responsible Letting.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;report recommends a programme of staged reforms based on principles of smart regulation. Following responses to our consultation paper, we propose a system of self-regulation designed to enhance voluntary initiatives already in place, leaving open the option of future reform to create a compulsory system. It is intended that implementation of our proposals would harmonise and simplify of the current system in an affordable way, with benefits to both landlords and tenants.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Consultation\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              On 13 July 2007 we published a consultation paper, in which we&nbsp;surveyed the development of regulation of the private rented sector and analysed recent developments in regulatory theory and practice.&nbsp;The paper presented provisional proposals aimed at encouraging better management of rented property. The consultation period closed on 12 October 2007.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The central proposal made in the consultation paper was for a scheme of \"enforced self-regulation\".&nbsp;Landlords would be required by law either to belong to an accredited self-regulatory organisation, or to let through an agent who is a member of an accredited agents' organisation.&nbsp;The self-regulatory organisations would be the existing or new national and regional landlords' associations or local authority schemes.&nbsp;Accreditation of organisations would be undertaken by a central regulator, which would oversee their codes of practice and disciplinary proceedings. The aim was that this scheme would replace courts and tribunals as the first port of call for disputes between landlords and tenants, and would remove incentives for landlords to keep property in poor repair (and evict tenants who object).<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The paper considered, but provisionally rejected, an enhanced version of voluntary self-regulation on the one hand, and a compulsory licensing scheme on the other.&nbsp;

It is complex, arcane and difficult to understand.&nbsp; It is also costly, as bills must be registered at the High Court.&nbsp; The consequences of not following the exacting formality requirements are severe; an error can void the whole loan, as well as the lender&rsquo;s security.&nbsp; The lack of protection for consumers also contrasts with modern consumer credit protections.&nbsp; Following default, the law allows a lender with a bill of sale to seize the property without a court order, which has been raised as a particular concern by consumer groups.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              If you would like to receive updates about this project, or if you would be happy for us to contact you in the course of our research, please email us your details to <a href=\"mailto:bills_of_sale@lawcommission.gsi.gov.uk\">bills_of_sale@lawcommission.gsi.gov.uk<\/a>.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Offences against Religion and Public Worship","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              We published a report on Offences against Religion and Public Worship (LC145) in 1985.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The principal recommendation of this report made its way on to the statute book after 23 years.&nbsp;The repeal of blasphemy and blasphemous libel, as recommended, was effected by section 79 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, which came into force on 8 July 2008.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              &nbsp;\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Feudal Land Law","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Status: This project&nbsp;no longer forms part of our work programme<br \/>\r\n              <br \/><\/strong>Commissioners have taken the view that other proposed law reform projects offer the potential for greater public benefit.&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The project originally formed part of our Ninth Programme.

The statutes reviewed (and on which we recommend repeal, either in whole or in part) span some 700 years of law-making, from 1267 through to 1988.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The statutes fall within eight categories:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Binding over\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Criminal process (in Scotland)\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Distress\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Extradition\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Forgery\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Fraud\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Police (principally for Northern Ireland)\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Sale of public offices.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The oldest of the statutes sought to regulate the levying of distress on goods and animals by sheriffs and bailiffs, to be enforced through civil proceedings (1267, and probably 1322), and empowered justices of the peace to bind over defendants in criminal proceedings (1361).&nbsp; Although the three statutes have historic value, their retention on the live statute book is no longer warranted.&nbsp; In each case their function has been overtaken by the enactment of 20th and 21st century legislation.&nbsp; The statutes applied initially in England - and later Wales - only, although those on distress were also extended to Ireland (now only Northern Ireland). ~<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              By contrast, the provisions dealt with in this consultation paper relating to criminal process, forgery and fraud focus on Scotland, where they are still alive, although the Acts also had some marginal impact on the remainder of the United Kingdom.&nbsp; The recommendation relating to police is founded on a 1969 Act which facilitated reciprocal policing arrangements between the then Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and mainland British police forces.&nbsp; This note focuses on Northern Ireland only.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Finally, political reforms over the past 140 years (underpinned by modern legislation culminating in the recent Bribery Act 2010) have rendered the 16th century statute on sale of offices (and its extending Act of 1809) unnecessary and devoid of practical purpose.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              None of the legislative provisions discussed in the present paper have practical usefulness today. Each is therefore recommended for whole or consequential partial repeal through the Law Commission&rsquo;s next Statute Law (Repeals) Bill, which is programmed for its parliamentary debut in Spring 2012.&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The closing date for comments on this consultation is 29 October 2010.<br \/>\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Claims for Wrongful Death","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Status: This project is complete.

Rather,&nbsp;we examined ways in which the existing law could be made more effective. There&nbsp;was a great deal of law that applied to the sector, but much of it did not work as Parliament intended. As a result, the standards set by the law were often not met, particularly in relation to the physical condition of housing. In turn, these failures contributed to the sector suffering from a poor reputation which, arguably, was getting in the way of it playing as full a part as it should in providing housing.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              The project\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              On 14 August 2008 we published our final proposals on better regulation of the private rented sector in the report Housing: Encouraging Responsible Letting.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;report recommends a programme of staged reforms based on principles of smart regulation. Following responses to our consultation paper, we propose a system of self-regulation designed to enhance voluntary initiatives already in place, leaving open the option of future reform to create a compulsory system.

The aim was that this scheme would replace courts and tribunals as the first port of call for disputes between landlords and tenants, and would remove incentives for landlords to keep property in poor repair (and evict tenants who object).<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The paper considered, but provisionally rejected, an enhanced version of voluntary self-regulation on the one hand, and a compulsory licensing scheme on the other.&nbsp; As an alternative, or additional, mechanism, the paper considered property certification, like an MOT test for housing.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Supplementary papers\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We also published:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <a href=\"\/docs\/Housing_Encouraging_Responsible_Letting_Supplementary_1.pdf\" title=\"PDF, opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">Supplementary Paper 1<\/a> - gives a more detailed explanation of the law on housing conditions, harassment and unlawful eviction.\r\n                <\/p>\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <a href=\"\/docs\/Housing_Encouraging_Responsible_Letting_Supplementary_2.pdf\" title=\"PDF, opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">Supplementary Paper 2<\/a> - deals in greater detail with estimating the costs of improving housing conditions.<br \/>\r\n                <\/p>\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              &nbsp;\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Consents to Prosecution","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Status: This project is complete.

Instead, landowners and responsible bodies are relying on complex and expensive legal workarounds, or the limited number of existing statutory covenants that enable certain covenants to be enforced by specified bodies (for example, the National Trust).\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              The project\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We began work on this project at the beginning of 2012 and have investigated whether there is a case for introducing conservation covenants into the law of England and Wales and, if so, what elements might be needed in a new statutory scheme for conservation covenants.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The Consultation Paper was published in March 2013, with consultation formally closing in June 2013.

This is subject to an exemption for &ldquo;the main subject matter of the contract&rdquo; and &ldquo;the adequacy of the price&hellip; as against the goods or services supplied in exchange&rdquo;.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              There is considerable uncertainty about the meaning of these words, following the 2009 Supreme Court decision in Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc.&nbsp;

It came into force on 6 April 2013.&nbsp; It relates to our project on <a href=\"\/areas\/insurance-contract-law.htm\">Insurance Contract Law<\/a><\/strong>\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission recommended the creation of a new consumer statute setting out what a consumer should tell their insurer before taking out insurance.&nbsp; The law under the Marine Insurance Act 1906 requires consumers to volunteer information about everything which a &ldquo;prudent insurer&rdquo; would consider relevant.&nbsp; We think this duty should be abolished. Instead, insurers should be required to ask questions about what they want to know.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The Marine Insurance Act 1906 (&ldquo;the 1906 Act&rdquo;) is based on eighteenth and nineteenth century principles.&nbsp;The law imposes a duty on consumers to tell insurers anything which would &ldquo;influence the judgment of a prudent insurer&rdquo; in fixing the premium or deciding whether to take the risk.&nbsp;The problem is that most consumers have little idea of what might influence a prudent insurer. Yet the penalties for failure to disclose information to insurers are harsh.&nbsp;If a consumer fails to disclose material information, the insurer may treat the policy as if it does not exist and refuse all claims under it.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The current law is inappropriate for modern consumer insurance and operates harshly. There are four main problems with the 1906 Act:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>The duty to disclose may operate as a trap for consumers, who are usually unaware that the duty exists.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Policyholders may be denied claims even when they have acted honestly and reasonably.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>The remedy may be overly severe. If the consumer has made a mistake, the insurer may refuse all claims, even claims which it would have paid had it been given full information.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Proposal forms sometimes state that the answers &ldquo;form the basis of the contract&rdquo;. In law, this means that if any statement is incorrect, the insurer may refuse all claims, even if the mistake is unimportant.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The case of Lambert v Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd [1975] 2 Lloyd&rsquo;s Rep 485 illustrates the problems with the duty to disclose. When Mrs Lambert insured her family&rsquo;s jewellery the insurer did not ask about her husband&rsquo;s previous convictions and she did not mention them. When Mrs Lambert claimed &pound;311 for lost jewellery, the insurer avoided the policy. The Court of Appeal held that the insurer was entitled to do so under the rules of law set out in the 1906 Act. The conviction was a material circumstance, which would have influenced a prudent insurer. It did not matter that a person in Mrs Lambert&rsquo;s position would not have realised this. The law was clear, though not necessarily fair.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The current law is complex and confusing. To mitigate the harshness of the 1906 Act, consumer insurance has been the subject of an array of industry codes, Financial Services Authority (&ldquo;FSA&rdquo;) rules and Financial Ombudsman Service (&ldquo;FOS&rdquo;) discretion.&nbsp;These various rules are overlapping and inconsistent adding to industry costs.<br \/>\r\n              Consumers are only able to obtain justice from the FOS, not from the courts. Although the FOS decides cases in a fair and reasonable way, it cannot help all those with disputes. Its compulsory jurisdiction is limited to awards of &pound;100,000, and the FOS declines cases which require witnesses to be cross-examined. If the consumer takes the case to court, the court must apply the 1906 Act. Confusion over the law penalises some vulnerable groups.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Particular problems exist for older consumers, for those with criminal convictions and for those with serious illnesses such as multiple sclerosis. The resulting muddle leads to a loss of confidence in the consumer insurance industry. This has particular relevance at a time when there has been discussion about insurance playing a bigger role in welfare provision.There is confusion over whether an intermediary (an agent or broker) acts for the consumer or the insurer. This is significant if an agent is deemed to have acted for the consumer, as the consumer is held responsible for the agent&rsquo;s actions.<br \/>\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              The project\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              On 15 December 2009, we presented to Government a report that included our recommendations and a draft Bill designed to implement them.<br \/>\r\n              The report followed a consultation that closed in July 2007.

It will abolish the consumer&rsquo;s duty to volunteer material facts. Instead, consumers must take reasonable care to answer their insurer&rsquo;s questions fully and accurately. If consumers do volunteer information, they must take reasonable care to ensure that the information is not misleading, and\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>will prescribe the insurer&rsquo;s remedies where they have been induced by a misrepresentation to enter into an insurance contract. The insurer&rsquo;s remedy will depend on the consumer&rsquo;s state of mind:\r\n                <ul>\r\n                  <li>if the misrepresentation was honest and reasonable, the insurer must pay the claim.

This will be followed by a discursive report (without draft legislation) in autumn 2016<br \/>\r\n              <br \/><\/strong>This project considers whether greater protection is needed for consumers who lose deposits or gift vouchers when retailers or other service providers become insolvent.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              A study by Consumer Focus in 2009 found that approximately 24.5 million prepayment transactions are made each year in the UK by around 20 million consumers.&nbsp; Prepayments are popular because they can be used to budget for big spends, such as Christmas, or as a deposit for major purchases like cars or new kitchens.&nbsp; On a smaller scale, gift vouchers and cards solve the dilemma of choosing the &ldquo;right&rdquo; gift.&nbsp; The benefits for businesses are that prepayments provide a cheap source of working capital and can lock in consumers to a particular brand.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              However, recent high-profile retailer insolvencies have highlighted the lack of protection for consumers making these kinds of payments.&nbsp; The collapse of the Farepak Christmas savings club in 2006 left many consumers out of pocket.&nbsp; More recently, unused gift vouchers worth &pound;4.7 million remained in circulation when Comet collapsed and home furnishings retailer Paul Simon held &pound;2.4m in customer deposits when it went into administration in April 2014.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              When a retailer becomes insolvent, the law imposes a strict hierarchy of creditors to be paid out from any remaining assets.&nbsp; Consumers, who are classed as unsecured creditors, are very near the bottom of the list and frequently receive nothing. &nbsp;In some cases, the administrator may decide to honour consumer prepayments and gift vouchers, though they are under no obligation to do so. &nbsp;Consumers are often unaware of the legal situation, and in some cases, conflicting information from administrators further confuses the situation.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The issues are complex and go to the heart of the insolvency regime. &nbsp;In 1982, the Cork report rejected greater protection for consumers, noting that consumers typically lose small and affordable amounts while the effect on suppliers can be catastrophic.&nbsp; But following the Farepak collapse, the Treasury Select Committee described the existing safety net as &ldquo;inadequate and incomplete&rdquo;. &nbsp;The OFT carried out a review, and ministers asked the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to consider providing more protection for consumers.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The project will consider possible ways forward, gathering empirical evidence about the scale of the problem and consulting on possible solutions.&nbsp; These include, for example, the order in which claims are paid in insolvency, the discretion administrators may exercise in consumers&rsquo; favour, voluntary protection in certain sectors and TSI&rsquo;s Consumer Code Approval Scheme, as well as the rules relating to the passing of property in a contract for the sale of goods.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              If you would like to receive updates about this project, or if you would be happy for us to contact you in the course of our research, please email your details to us at <a href=\"mailto:prepayments@lawcommission.gsi.gov.uk\">prepayments@lawcommission.gsi.gov.uk<\/a>.<br \/>\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Consumer Redress for Misleading and Aggressive Practices","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Status: This project is complete.&nbsp;

Consumer Focus commissioned research which found that almost two-thirds of the population had fallen victim to a misleading or aggressive practice within the last two years, causing an estimated consumer detriment of &pound;3.3 billion a year.&nbsp; A large proportion of the victims are among the most vulnerable in society, with housebound and older people facing a particular threat from high-pressure, doorstep selling.&nbsp; Under the existing laws that govern misleading and aggressive practices it is difficult, if not impossible, for consumers to get their money back.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              In May 2008, the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations implemented the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive into UK law.&nbsp; They provide that traders must not use &ldquo;unfair commercial practices&rdquo; against consumers.&nbsp; Whilst the Regulations cover many of the unfair practices consumers complain about, they can only be enforced by the Office of Fair Trading or Trading Standards.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Consumers have to rely on private law rights if they want to take action.&nbsp;

The law has been consolidated before, most recently in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              That Act has been heavily amended and supplemented by a number of subsequent Acts and Statutory Instruments altering the law relating to these societies. The significant legislative activity has partly been due to the need to keep up with developments in company law, changes to the regulation of financial services and changes to EU law.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Registration under the existing legislation gives a society corporate personality with limited liability and so provides an alternative legal form to registration under the companies legislation. While some aspects of the legislation have been assimilated with the corresponding company law there remain many differences.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The conditions for registration have become tighter over the years. A society must now be a bona fide co-operative society or conducted for the public benefit in order to apply successfully for registration.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              It is important that the legislation is as clear as possible. Some of it is complicated and technical and it is not easy to navigate around the various separate enactments on the subject or to understand how the legislation as a whole fits together. These are some of the reasons why consolidation is necessary.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              The Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Bill\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The Bill from which the Act derives replaces the legislation on the relevant societies listed in Schedule 7.&nbsp; The material listed includes some provisions that are spent or otherwise obsolete, such as provisions textually amending Acts consolidated in the Bill. Those provisions are not reproduced in the Bill.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The Bill takes account of some changes to the law that are planned to be made by statutory instrument in the current Session of Parliament. These will implement provisions of the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2010, among other things.&nbsp; The Treasury&nbsp;has recently consulted&nbsp;on a package of measures relating to co-operative and community benefit societies and credit unions.&nbsp;Amendments to be made by these measures to the Industrial and Provident Societies 1965 Act are included in the consolidation Bill. These measures include:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>raising the limit on the amount of withdrawable share capital that a registered society may hold,\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>applying, with modifications, the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 for company voluntary arrangements and administration,\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>applying, with modifications, Part 14 of the Companies Act 1985 relating to investigations, and\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>allowing for the electronic submission of registration documents.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The consolidation does not include the corresponding societies legislation in Northern Ireland, which has always been separate from the law in Great Britain.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Nor does it include the legislation about credit unions contained in the Credit Unions Act 1979. Credit unions are another form of mutual entity. Currently, these are registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 and some provisions of that Act and other legislation consolidated by the&nbsp;Bill are currently &ldquo;applied&rdquo; to credit unions, with modifications. The decision not to include credit union legislation in the Bill left the drafter with a choice between leaving the old societies legislation in place as it applies to credit unions or repealing it and adapting the references in credit union law to refer to the relevant provisions of the Bill. The decision has been made to take the latter approach.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The aim of the consolidation is to reproduce the effect of the current legislation, while putting the law into a more logical, accessible, clear and modern form. This includes using gender neutral language and altering archaic language wherever possible. Developments in the general law (including EU law) also have to be taken into account &ndash; for example if they have made existing provisions obsolete or unnecessary or left them giving a misleading or incomplete account of the law.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The only substantive changes to the law included in the Bill are those recommended by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission in order to facilitate the production of a satisfactory consolidated text. Changes affecting only&nnbsp;one jurisdiction&nbsp;(England and Wales or&nbsp;Scotland) are recommended by the appropriate Law Commission. Changes affecting both jurisdictions are made jointly.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The scope of what can be dealt with by Law Commission recommendation is limited. The parliamentary procedure for consolidation Bills is not designed for significant changes of policy. The only changes that can be made are to address technical issues that emerge during the process of consolidating the law.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Bribery","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Status: This project is complete.

There&nbsp;was a great deal of law that applied to the sector, but much of it did not work as Parliament intended. As a result, the standards set by the law were often not met, particularly in relation to the physical condition of housing. In turn, these failures contributed to the sector suffering from a poor reputation which, arguably, was getting in the way of it playing as full a part as it should in providing housing.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              The project\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              On 14 August 2008 we published our final proposals on better regulation of the private rented sector in the report Housing: Encouraging Responsible Letting.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;report recommends a programme of staged reforms based on principles of smart regulation. Following responses to our consultation paper, we propose a system of self-regulation designed to enhance voluntary initiatives already in place, leaving open the option of future reform to create a compulsory system.

We await the Government's response to our recommendations<br \/>\r\n              <br \/><\/strong>This project addressed the admissibility of expert evidence in criminal proceedings in England and Wales. In a criminal trial, a jury or magistrates' court is required to determine disputed factual issues. Experts in a relevant field are often called as witnesses to help the fact-finding body understand and interpret evidence with which that body is unfamiliar.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The current judicial approach to the admissibility of expert evidence in England and Wales is one of laissez-faire. Too much expert opinion evidence is admitted without adequate scrutiny because no clear test is being applied to determine whether the evidence is sufficiently reliable to be admitted. This problem is exacerbated in two ways:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  First, because expert evidence (particularly scientific evidence) will often be technical and complex, jurors will understandably lack the experience to be able to assess the reliability of such evidence. There is a danger that they may simply defer to the opinion of the specialist who has been called to provide expert evidence.\r\n                <\/p>\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  Secondly, in the absence of a clear legal test to ensure the reliability of expert evidence, advocates do not always cross-examine experts effectively to reveal potential flaws in the experts' methodology, data and reasoning. Juries may therefore be reaching conclusions on the basis of unreliable evidence. This conclusion is confirmed by a number of miscarriages of justice in recent years.\r\n                <\/p>\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              The project\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We published a consultation paper on 7 April 2009, in which we made a number of provisional proposals which would reform the law governing the admissibility of expert evidence in criminal proceedings in England and Wales. The consultation period closed in July 2009.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In our 2009 consultation paper we agreed with the view of the House of Commons&rsquo; Science and Technology Committee that a reliability test for expert evidence should be formulated in partnership with judges, scientists and other key players in the criminal justice system. Our provisional view that there should be a new reliability-based admissibility test was broadly (but not universally) supported by our many consultees, including judges, scientists and other key players in the criminal justice system.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              A summary of the responses we received is available.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Following consultation, we formulated our final recommendations, produced draft legislation and again consulted with judges, lawyers and experts to ensure that our draft provisions would give effect to our recommendations and would work in practice.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Our recommendations\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Our final recommendations and our draft Criminal Evidence (Experts) Bill are set out in the report we published on 22 March 2011, Expert Evidence in Criminal Proceedings in England and Wales.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In the report we formally recommend that there should be a new reliability-based admissibility test for expert evidence in criminal proceedings. The test would not need to be applied routinely or unnecessarily, but it would be applied in appropriate cases and it would result in the exclusion of unreliable expert opinion evidence. Under the test, expert opinion evidence would not be admitted unless it was adjudged to be sufficiently reliable to go before a jury. Accordingly, juries would be less likely to reach their conclusions on unreliable evidence and there would be fewer miscarriages of justice, which would result in greater public confidence in the criminal justice system.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The draft Criminal Evidence (Experts) Bill published with the report (as Appendix A) sets out the admissibility test that judges would apply to exclude unreliable expert evidence. Importantly, it also provides the guidance judges would need when applying the test, setting out the key reasons why an expert&rsquo;s opinion evidence might be unreliable. The Bill also makes allowance for the possibility that specific factors may be approved in the fullness of time for assessing the reliability of particular fields of expert evidence, such as statistical or psychiatric evidence.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The Bill also codifies (with slight modifications) the uncontroversial aspects of the present law, so that all the admissibility requirements for expert evidence would be set out in a single Act of Parliament and carry equal authority. Additionally, the Bill includes a number of procedural rules and provisions which would give the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee the power to create further procedural rules, to supplement the provisions in the Bill.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The recommendations in the report and the provisions in the Bill would establish a proper framework in criminal proceedings for screening expert evidence at the admissibility stage. They would also encourage higher standards amongst expert witnesses, and the specialists on whom they rely, resulting in expert evidence of greater reliability being tendered for admission.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Simplification of the Criminal Law","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Status:&nbsp; We consulted on&nbsp;Public Nuisance and Outraging Public Decency in Spring 2010 and&nbsp;on Kidnapping in Autumn 2011.&nbsp; We published our final recommendations relating to Kidnapping and Related Offences in November 2014<\/strong><br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              In the <a href=\"\/publications\/programmes-law-reform.htm\">10th Programme<\/a>, the Commission&nbsp;embarked on a programme of simplification of the criminal law, criminal evidence and procedure.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Simplification involves:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>giving the law a clearer structure;\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>using more modern terminology;\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>making the law in a given area more consistent with other closely allied areas of law;\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>making the law readily comprehensible to non lawyers by ensuring that it embodies sound and sensible concepts of fairness.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The Commission continues to support the objective of codifying the law, and will continue to codify where it can, but considers that it needs to redefine its approach to make codification more achievable.

For example, no definitions are given for key terms such as &ldquo;antique&rdquo;, &ldquo;imitation&rdquo;, &ldquo;lethal&rdquo; and even &ldquo;weapon&rdquo;. There is considerable overlap between offences, making it difficult to establish clearly which charges apply in an individual case. The law has also failed to keep abreast with modern technology, and in particular with the availability of equipment that can be used to convert objects into active firearms.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The implications are serious and wide-ranging. Experts are taking longer to classify weapons, prosecutors are struggling to select appropriate charges and there are many examples of defendants escaping prosecution on a technicality by successfully arguing that the weapon in their possession has been wrongly identified.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Public confidence in the criminal justice system is understandably dented when defendants walk free because the statutes designed to criminalise their behaviour are not fit for use in the modern age. This scoping exercise will survey the current landscape, identify the problems with the law and propose a range of reform possibilities. It will consider the enactment of a single statute, containing modified and simplified versions of all firearms offences and providing clear definitions of all relevant terms.<br \/>\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Unfitness to Plead","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Status: On 2 May 2014 we published an Issues Paper.&nbsp; The consultation period is now closed<\/strong><br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The law on unfitness to plead addresses what should happen when a defendant who faces criminal prosecution is unable to engage with the process because of their mental or physical condition.&nbsp; Such a defendant may be found &ldquo;unfit to plead&rdquo;.&nbsp; He or she is not tried in the usual way, but undergoes a different process to decide whether they did the act which is the substance of the criminal charge; if it is found that they did, they may be detained in a hospital or supervised in the community.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The legal test which is used to decide whether a defendant is &ldquo;unfit to plead&rdquo; has a number of limitations.&nbsp; It dates from 1836 when the science of psychiatry was in its infancy and does not adequately reflect advances in modern psychiatric and psychological thinking.&nbsp; In addition, the law on unfitness to plead has developed in a piecemeal way and independently of development of the right to &lsquo;effective participation&rdquo; as part of the fair trial guarantees under article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The legal test for unfitness to plead needs to be reformed so that it achieves a fair balance between protecting vulnerable defendants who may be unable to defend themselves properly in a criminal trial, and ensuring that the rights of victims and the security of the general public are properly addressed.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Consultation\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We published our consultation paper on 27 October 2010, which contained our provisional proposals for comprehensive reform of the law on unfitness to plead in England and Wales.&nbsp; We received over 50 responses and on 10 April 2013 we published an analysis of those responses.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              We are now reviewing our provisional proposals in light of the consultation responses, and taking into account the changes to the criminal justice system since we produced the consultation paper in October 2010.&nbsp; In doing so, we have identified a number of further questions on which invite additional input from stakeholders.&nbsp; The purpose of asking these further questions is to ensure that our final recommendations to government are practical and properly reflect the experience and views of all those who encounter these issues, whether by working within the criminal justice system, or experiencing it as a victim, witness, defendant or general member of the public.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              We have set out these further questions in our issues paper, to which we invite response by 25 July 2014.&nbsp; We would be most grateful if consultees would use the response form.&nbsp; Both documents are accessible on this page.&nbsp; Please follow the instructions carefully when completing this form.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              These further questions address issues such as:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>How should special measures to enhance the defendant&rsquo;s ability to participate in trial be fairly incorporated into the test for unfitness?\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Should the procedure in the magistrates&rsquo; and youth courts mirror that in the Crown Court?\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>What should the process be for dealing with a defendant when he or she has been found unfit to plead?\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>At a hearing to deal with a defendant found unfit, what issues should be considered by the court?\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>What options should the court have in dealing with unfit defendants?\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Symposium, 11 June 2014\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              To support our consultation, we have invited over 100 leading experts in criminal law and mental health to a <a href=\"\/docs\/Unfitness_to_Plead_Symposium_Programme.pdf\" title=\"PDF, opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">symposium<\/a> on 11 June at Leeds University School of Law.

We recommended that where a potential heir is disqualified from inheriting under the forfeiture rule, or has disclaimed an inheritance, the estate should be distributed as if that person had died.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Where the deceased was unlawfully killed and does not leave a will, the killer&rsquo;s share which has been forfeited should pass to the next in line; for example, if a son unlawfully kills his parents, his share in their estates under the intestacy rules should pass to his children, the deceased&rsquo;s grandchildren.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Where a will states that money is left \"to A, but if they should predecease me, to B\", and A forfeits the inheritance, it should pass to B.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Where a potential heir disclaims an inheritance (either under a will or on intestacy), it should pass to the person who would have received the money had the first heir died.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The report also recommended removing a small anomaly in intestacy law. If X dies without leaving a will, and an heir such as a child or sibling dies unmarried under the age of 18 but leaves children, the inheritance should pass as though the heir had predeceased X; that is, to the heir&rsquo;s children who could have inherited directly from X.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Implementation\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In 2006 the Government accepted the recommendations made in our report.

Other powers were transferred to the Assembly by statute. In 2007, these functions were transferred to Welsh ministers, and provision was made for transferring legislative competence either by statute or by legislative consent order. The system changed in 2011, and the National Assembly now has broader powers to make laws in devolved areas.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              As a result, it can be very difficult to find and understand the law in devolved areas. The problem is particularly acute in respect of executive powers, but is certainly not confined to them. For example, a power which, on the face of a statute, appears to be exercised by the Secretary of State may in fact have been transferred to Welsh ministers. However, this will not be apparent without in-depth research. Pre-devolution statutes may have been subsequently amended, so that they now contain some provisions that cover England and Wales, some that relate to England and some that are specific to Wales only.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              This project will be purely advisory, and our final report will not contain a draft Bill.

Its communicative power lies in the requirement that the judge declares in open court that the offender&rsquo;s sentence has been increased because the hate element has made the offence more serious. But it is being under-used and no adequate record is made of cases where it has been applied. If reformed, it could be an effective response to crimes involving hostility based on transgender identity, sexual orientation and disability.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              We recommend two reforms which we believe will help the system of enhanced sentencing achieve its full potential:<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              (1)&nbsp;New guidance from the Sentencing Council on the sentencing approach in hate crime cases; and<br \/>\r\n              (2)&nbsp;Every time enhanced sentencing is applied, this should be recorded on the offender&rsquo;s criminal record in the Police National Computer (PNC) so that the record will show the offence was aggravated by hostility, just as it would show a conviction for an aggravated offence.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              These reforms should be introduced whether or not aggravated offences are extended.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h3>\r\n              The aggravated offences\r\n            <\/h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In principle, the aggravated offences should apply equally to hostility based on race, religion, transgender identity, sexual orientation and disability. The current inequality would have been a sufficiently strong reason to recommend the immediate extension of the offences, were it not for the serious concerns some consultees have raised about problems with the aggravated offences and unnecessary complexities in their form and operation.&nbsp; Alterations would also need to be made to ensure the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; offences listed were suitable for tackling hate crime against disabled, LGB and transgender people.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              As our terms of reference only allowed us to consider extending the offences in their current form, we could not look at these questions in this project.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Therefore, prior to any extension of the offences, we recommend a full-scale review of their operation.

The final report and draft Bill sets out a new single legal framework for the regulation of all health and social care professionals. The reforms aim to sweep away the out-dated and inflexible decision-making processes associated with the current legislation.

The draft Bill therefore targets Government oversight on key areas where there is sufficient public interest and matters that give rise to questions about the allocation of public resources.

In turn, these failures contributed to the sector suffering from a poor reputation which, arguably, was getting in the way of it playing as full a part as it should in providing housing.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              The project\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              On 14 August 2008 we published our final proposals on better regulation of the private rented sector in the report Housing: Encouraging Responsible Letting.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;report recommends a programme of staged reforms based on principles of smart regulation. Following responses to our consultation paper, we propose a system of self-regulation designed to enhance voluntary initiatives already in place, leaving open the option of future reform to create a compulsory system. It is intended that implementation of our proposals would harmonise and simplify of the current system in an affordable way, with benefits to both landlords and tenants.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Consultation\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              On 13 July 2007 we published a consultation paper, in which we&nbsp;surveyed the development of regulation of the private rented sector and analysed recent developments in regulatory theory and practice.&nbsp;The paper presented provisional proposals aimed at encouraging better management of rented property. The consultation period closed on 12 October 2007.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The central proposal made in the consultation paper was for a scheme of \"enforced self-regulation\".&nbsp;Landlords would be required by law either to belong to an accredited self-regulatory organisation, or to let through an agent who is a member of an accredited agents' organisation.&nbsp;The self-regulatory organisations would be the existing or new national and regional landlords' associations or local authority schemes.&nbsp;Accreditation of organisations would be undertaken by a central regulator, which would oversee their codes of practice and disciplinary proceedings. The aim was that this scheme would replace courts and tribunals as the first port of call for disputes between landlords and tenants, and would remove incentives for landlords to keep property in poor repair (and evict tenants who object).<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The paper considered, but provisionally rejected, an enhanced version of voluntary self-regulation on the one hand, and a compulsory licensing scheme on the other.&nbsp; As an alternative, or additional, mechanism, the paper considered property certification, like an MOT test for housing.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Supplementary papers\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We also published:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <a href=\"\/docs\/Housing_Encouraging_Responsible_Letting_Supplementary_1.pdf\" title=\"PDF, opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">Supplementary Paper 1<\/a> - gives a more detailed explanation of the law on housing conditions, harassment and unlawful eviction.\r\n                <\/p>\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <a href=\"\/docs\/Housing_Encouraging_Responsible_Letting_Supplementary_2.pdf\" title=\"PDF, opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">Supplementary Paper 2<\/a> - deals in greater detail with estimating the costs of improving housing conditions.<br \/>\r\n                <\/p>\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              &nbsp;\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Renting Homes","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Status: This project is complete.

The Acts span nearly a century of railway enterprise, but all are now obsolete. They centred on the individual railway companies (which originated in England) and on the projects they were created to deliver within the Indian sub-continent.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The first regular train service (between Mumbai and Thane) was established by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company in 1854 following the passing of an 1849 Act - which incorporated the company and gave it power to enter into contracts with the East India Company. At the other end of the spectrum, legislation from 1942 put into liquidation the Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway Company when its underlying purpose was finished and its operation had been sold to the government. Across those decades the railway endeavour stretched in its furthest reach from Pakistan in the west, through India and Bangladesh, into Myanmar in the east, and down to Sri Lanka in the south.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The East India Company (trading from 1600 to 1874) had significant influence and political power in British India, not least because it exercised quasi-governmental authority on behalf of the British Crown for all but its last 16 years. Having recognised the commercial and communication value of railways in England in the first half of the 19th century, the Company commissioned the development of a rail network in India. What followed was a surge of development, first financed in part by a guarantee system (benefiting the embryonic English companies), and later financed more directly by government.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The enabling Acts followed a similar pattern.

This would achieve a balance between enabling democratically elected bodies to account to their electorate for failures in performance through an effective inquiry, but without putting powers of compulsion in the hands of a non-judicial body.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              &nbsp;\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Unfitness to Plead","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Status: On 2 May 2014 we published an Issues Paper.&nbsp; The consultation period is now closed<\/strong><br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The law on unfitness to plead addresses what should happen when a defendant who faces criminal prosecution is unable to engage with the process because of their mental or physical condition.&nbsp; Such a defendant may be found &ldquo;unfit to plead&rdquo;.&nbsp; He or she is not tried in the usual way, but undergoes a different process to decide whether they did the act which is the substance of the criminal charge; if it is found that they did, they may be detained in a hospital or supervised in the community.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The legal test which is used to decide whether a defendant is &ldquo;unfit to plead&rdquo; has a number of limitations.&nbsp; It dates from 1836 when the science of psychiatry was in its infancy and does not adequately reflect advances in modern psychiatric and psychological thinking.&nbsp; In addition, the law on unfitness to plead has developed in a piecemeal way and independently of development of the right to &lsquo;effective participation&rdquo; as part of the fair trial guarantees under article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The legal test for unfitness to plead needs to be reformed so that it achieves a fair balance between protecting vulnerable defendants who may be unable to defend themselves properly in a criminal trial, and ensuring that the rights of victims and the security of the general public are properly addressed.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Consultation\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We published our consultation paper on 27 October 2010, which contained our provisional proposals for comprehensive reform of the law on unfitness to plead in England and Wales.&nbsp; We received over 50 responses and on 10 April 2013 we published an analysis of those responses.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              We are now reviewing our provisional proposals in light of the consultation responses, and taking into account the changes to the criminal justice system since we produced the consultation paper in October 2010.&nbsp; In doing so, we have identified a number of further questions on which invite additional input from stakeholders.&nbsp; The purpose of asking these further questions is to ensure that our final recommendations to government are practical and properly reflect the experience and views of all those who encounter these issues, whether by working within the criminal justice system, or experiencing it as a victim, witness, defendant or general member of the public.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              We have set out these further questions in our issues paper, to which we invite response by 25 July 2014.&nbsp; We would be most grateful if consultees would use the response form.&nbsp; Both documents are accessible on this page.&nbsp; Please follow the instructions carefully when completing this form.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              These further questions address issues such as:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>How should special measures to enhance the defendant&rsquo;s ability to participate in trial be fairly incorporated into the test for unfitness?\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Should the procedure in the magistrates&rsquo; and youth courts mirror that in the Crown Court?\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>What should the process be for dealing with a defendant when he or she has been found unfit to plead?\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>At a hearing to deal with a defendant found unfit, what issues should be considered by the court?\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>What options should the court have in dealing with unfit defendants?\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Symposium, 11 June 2014\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              To support our consultation, we have invited over 100 leading experts in criminal law and mental health to a <a href=\"\/docs\/Unfitness_to_Plead_Symposium_Programme.pdf\" title=\"PDF, opens in a new window\" target=\"_blank\">symposium<\/a> on 11 June at Leeds University School of Law.

This might amount to a defence of \"sane automatism\" under the current law.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The current rules that govern the insanity defence (also referred to as \"insane automatism\") date from 1843.&nbsp;

In&nbsp;this paper we took a broader view of housing dispute resolution.&nbsp;The starting point was the problems that people encounter with housing, and how they can be best resolved. This fits in with the policy of the Ministry of Justice (the then Department for Constitutional Affairs) on the need for more user-focused services (see below).&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The issues paper set out our proposals for a more coherent system of housing dispute resolution comprising:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>use of a \"triage plus\" process, diagnosing individual and wider housing problems, referring them to appropriate resolution methods, and collecting information about housing problems and how they are resolved\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>use of dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation, ombudsmen and managerial techniques, and\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>where needed, use of a court or tribunal.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The values underpinning such a system should be stated explicitly.

an error can void the whole loan, as well as the lender&rsquo;s security.&nbsp; The lack of protection for consumers also contrasts with modern consumer credit protections.&nbsp; Following default, the law allows a lender with a bill of sale to seize the property without a court order, which has been raised as a particular concern by consumer groups.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              If you would like to receive updates about this project, or if you would be happy for us to contact you in the course of our research, please email us your details to <a href=\"mailto:bills_of_sale@lawcommission.gsi.gov.uk\">bills_of_sale@lawcommission.gsi.gov.uk<\/a>.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"London Repeal Proposals (2)","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              In our consultation we have identified some 94 obsolete Acts relating to London.&nbsp;

In 2004, a case before the European Court of Human Rights established that the informal admission to a psychiatric hospital of a compliant but incapacitated person was capable of amounting to a deprivation of liberty under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&nbsp; The UK was found to be in breach of the Article, because in such circumstances the law in England and Wales did not provide for an adequate system of authorisation and review of the deprivation of liberty.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              In 2007, in reaction to the finding, the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) were introduced into the Mental Capacity Act 2005 by the Mental Health Act 2007.&nbsp; They were introduced in order to plug the gap identified in the case, and to ensure that such situations are properly regulated in line with the person&rsquo;s human rights.&nbsp; DoLS applies only to deprivations of liberty that take place in hospitals and care homes. If a person&rsquo;s right to liberty is compromised in other settings, his or her deprivation of liberty has to be authorised and supervised by the Court of Protection.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The DoLS provisions have been criticised since they were introduced for being overly complex and excessively bureaucratic.&nbsp; It is said that staff often do not understand them and that there is confusion over the differences between the powers of the Mental Health Act 1983 and DoLS.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              In March 2014 a House of Lords select committee conducting a post-legislative scrutiny of the Mental Capacity Act found that DoLS were not &ldquo;fit for purpose&rdquo; and called for them to be replaced.&nbsp; The committee also recommended that the new system should extend to cover people in supported living arrangements, not just hospitals and care homes.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, the Supreme Court found that a person will be deprived of their liberty in more situations than had previously been thought to be the case.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Our project considers how deprivation of liberty should be authorised and supervised in hospitals, care homes and community settings, where it is possible that Article 5 rights would otherwise be infringed.&nbsp;

Breaching the rule against perpetuities will result in a settlor&rsquo;s wishes being ineffective to a greater or lesser extent.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The rule against excessive accumulations was originally enacted in the 1800s, and has always been a statutory rule. It applies where a disposition carries a duty or a power to accumulate income; that is, to add income to capital, instead of the income being distributed.&nbsp;The rule against excessive accumulations places restrictions on the period of time during which income may be accumulated (see section 164 of the Law of Property Act 1925 and section 13 of the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964). In 1989 the Law Commission proposed examining both rules as part of its Fourth Programme of Law Reform.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              The project\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The Law Commission published a consultation paper in 1993, identifying potential defects in the current law. The consultation paper suggested four options in relation to the rule against perpetuities: no change in the law; abolishing the rule against perpetuities; replacing the rule against perpetuities with a new rule; or reforming the rule against perpetuities.&nbsp;The consultation paper also proposed three alternative approaches in respect of the rule against excessive accumulations: no change in the law; abolishing the rule; or reforming it.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The consultation paper attracted 62 detailed responses from a range of individuals and groups.&nbsp;Consultees included several major representative bodies (such as the Charity Law Association, the Chancery Bar Association, the British Bankers&rsquo; Association, and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners), members of the legal profession and the judiciary, and distinguished academics.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              As a result of consultees&rsquo; comments, the Law Commission identified a number of problems with the existing rule against perpetuities and the rule against excessive accumulations.&nbsp; In particular:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  The application of the rule against perpetuities has developed over time and is now too wide.&nbsp; It applies to many commercial dealings (such as future easements, options and rights of pre-emption) which have nothing to do with the family settlements that the rule was designed to control.\r\n                <\/p>\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  The application of the rule to pension schemes is not consistent with the policy of the rule.&nbsp; Although there is an exception for most pension schemes from the rule against perpetuities, a small number of pension schemes fell outside of the exemption, and are subject to the rule.&nbsp; The Commission&rsquo;s view was that there was no sound policy basis for this group of pension schemes being subject to the rule against perpetuities.\r\n                <\/p>\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  The existence of multiple methods for calculating the perpetuity period (which includes the use of lives in being at common law, as well as periods of up to 80 years under the 1964 Act) is unnecessarily complex and confusing. In addition, the use of lives in being gives rise to practical difficulties. For example, where a \"royal lives clause\" has been used, it may be impossible for the trustees to identify who the last remaining descendants of a monarch are, or indeed whether they are still alive.\r\n                <\/p>\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  In relation to the rule against excessive accumulations, the Law Commission found that there was no longer a sound policy basis for restricting settlors&rsquo; ability to direct or allow for the accumulation of income, except in the case of charitable trusts (for which there is a public interest in limiting the time for accumulations, so that income is spent for the public benefit, rather than accumulated indefinitely).\r\n                <\/p>\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Following this consultation, the Law Commission produced its final report, \"The Rules Against Perpetuities and Excessive Accumulations\" in 1998, accompanied by a draft Bill.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Implementation\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The Law Commission&rsquo;s recommendations were accepted by Government, and in 2009 the Perpetuities and Accumulations Bill was introduced in Parliament.&nbsp;The Bill proceeded through Parliament via a trial procedure for Law Commission Bills and received Royal Assent on 12 November 2009.&nbsp;The Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 2009, which modernises and simplifies the law on leaving property in trust, came fully into force on 6 April 2010 by virtue of a Commencement Order announced in Parliament by Justice Minister Bridget Prentice.&nbsp;The Act is the first of two pieces of primary legislation to enter Parliament under&nbsp;the trial of a House of Lords procedure for legislation implementing Law Commission recommendations.

financial needs.&nbsp; The meaning of &ldquo;needs&rdquo; in this context has generated uncertainty and there is confusion, for those separating, about the extent to which one spouse should be required to meet the other&rsquo;s needs after their formal relationship has come to an end.&nbsp; Another area of uncertainty is how the courts treat property that one party brought into the relationship or acquired by gift or inheritance during it.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The project also considered the treatment of pre-nuptial, post-nuptial and separation agreements.&nbsp; These are agreements made between couples before or during their marriage or civil partnership as to how their property and finances will be dealt with if they were to separate.&nbsp; Such agreements are not currently enforceable but the judgment of the Supreme Court in Radmacher v Granatino [2010] UKSC 42 said that they should be given &ldquo;decisive weight&rdquo;

It was agreed with the Ministry of Justice that the scope of the project should be extended to include a targeted review of two aspects of financial provision on divorce and the dissolution of a civil partnership: financial needs and non-matrimonial property.&nbsp; We opened a supplementary consultation in September 2012.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The project was not a full-scale reform project directed at the entirety of the law of financial orders.&nbsp; Rather, the aim was to bring clarity and predictability to areas of that law that cause particular difficulties.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Altogether, we received almost 150 consultation responses from members of the public, lawyers and other professionals and organisations.&nbsp;

This would ensure that the law is applied consistently by the courts and reinforce judicial best practice.&nbsp; Guidance will also give people without legal representation access to a clear statement of their responsibilities and the objective of a transition to independence that a financial settlement should achieve.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Investigate the possibility of whether an aid to calculation of &ldquo;financial needs&rdquo;

These would be enforceable contracts, which would enable couples to make binding arrangements for the financial consequences of divorce or dissolution.&nbsp; In order for an agreement to be a &ldquo;qualifying&rdquo;

A large proportion of the victims are among the most vulnerable in society, with housebound and older people facing a particular threat from high-pressure, doorstep selling.&nbsp; Under the existing laws that govern misleading and aggressive practices it is difficult, if not impossible, for consumers to get their money back.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              In May 2008, the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations implemented the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive into UK law.&nbsp;

The final report and draft Bill sets out a new single legal framework for the regulation of all health and social care professionals. The reforms aim to sweep away the out-dated and inflexible decision-making processes associated with the current legislation. The new legal framework would introduce a clear and consistent legal framework which is needed to enable the regulators to uphold their duty to protect the public.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In many areas, the reforms consolidate and simplifies the existing legal framework.&nbsp; The draft Bill also imposes greater consistency across the regulators in some areas where this is necessary in the public interest (such as the conduct of fitness to practise hearings).&nbsp; Otherwise the regulators would be given greater autonomy to be able to deliver its functions in a way that is suited to the profession concerned.&nbsp; This would include broad powers to make or amend rules concerning issues such as registration and renewals, and education, standards and continuing professional development &ndash; which are not subject to approval by Government or any Parliamentary procedure.&nbsp; There would be a requirement on the regulators to consult when considering changes to their rules and a requirement that each regulator must provide information to the public and registrants about its work.&nbsp; The procedures for making new rules would also be subject to oversight by the Professional Standards Authority.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The draft Bill also reforms the role of Government in professional regulation. The draft Bill therefore targets Government oversight on key areas where there is sufficient public interest and matters that give rise to questions about the allocation of public resources. Government is also given default powers to intervene in cases of regulatory failure.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Government response\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              On 29 January 2015, the Government accepted our recommendations that there should be:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>a single, overarching objective of public protection placed on each regulator\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>wider powers and greater flexibility for the regulators to investigate and dispose of cases\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>greater consistency in the conduct of fitness to practise panels\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>greater separation between the regulators' investigation and adjudication functions\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>an overarching duty on the regulators to ensure the ongoing fitness to practice of registrants, and\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>greater flexibility in how the regulators oversee medical schools and other forms of education.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The Government made the announcement&nbsp;by <a href=\"%20http:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/business\/publications\/written-questions-answers-statements\/written-statement\/Commons\/2015-01-29\/HCWS235\/\" target=\"_new\">Written Ministerial Statement<\/a> from Dr Daniel Poulter MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Health, and has committed to legislate, when parliamentary time allows, to implement these reforms.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Nicholas Paines QC, Law Commissioner for Public Law in England and Wales, said:<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              \"The framework for promoting high standards of professional practice and behaviour, and holding health and social care professionals to account needs to be brought up to date and made fit for the future.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              &ldquo;We have recommended that the existing legislation be swept away and replaced with a coherent legal framework, within which each regulator should be driven by the single objective of public protection.

Currently, the law lacks coherence and clarity: it is spread across&nbsp;many statutes, and frequent updates are brought into force at different times by different statutory instruments and have a variety of transitional arrangements.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              This makes it difficult, if not impossible at times, for practitioners and the courts to understand what the present law of sentencing procedure actually is. This can lead to delays, costly appeals and unlawful sentences. A survey of 400 Court of Appeal cases from 2012 by the sentencing expert Robert Banks found that 262 were appeals against sentences and that of these, 95 related to sentences that had been unlawfully passed in the Crown Court. Banks wrote, &ldquo;[This] figure shows that we can no longer say the sentencing system is working properly. Cases since then have indicated that these figures are not unrepresentative.&rdquo;\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              There seems to be near unanimity from legal practitioners, judges and academic lawyers that the law in this area is in urgent need of reform. The courts have repeatedly complained about the complexity of modern sentencing procedure. There is strong evidence that the high number of unlawful sentences being handed down is a direct result of the inability of judges to find their way through the relevant provisions. This undermines public confidence in sentencing and costs a great deal of public money to rectify on appeal.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Our aim in this project is to introduce a single sentencing statute that will act as the first and only port of call for sentencing tribunals. It will set out the relevant provisions in a clear and logical way, and ensure that all updates to sentencing procedure can be found in a single place. It is not the aim of this project to interfere with mandatory minimum sentences or with sentencing tariffs in general. Those will remain entirely untouched, but the process by which they come to be imposed will be streamlined and much improved.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              At this early stage of the project, we are asking practitioners and judges for further examples of the problems that can arise as a result of flaws within the existing system. We would like to hear about particular instances or types of situation where the current process is adversely affected by the structure, complexity, drafting or volume of legislation.

The law on sentencing is highly complex and contained in a dizzying array of separate but overlapping sources. For that reason sentencing procedure represents an obvious candidate for consolidation and simplification.\"\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Lord Justice Treacy, Chairman, Sentencing Council:<br \/>\r\n                <br \/>\r\n                \"A sentencing code, containing a single comprehensive statement of the procedure to be followed after an offender&rsquo;s conviction, would greatly increase the accessibility and clarity of the law in this area. This would reduce the potential for confusion which may create real problems in practice. This in turn would help promote fairness and consistency in sentencing. It could also increase the impact of the Sentencing Council&rsquo;s work by allowing judges to focus on the key issue: the correct sentence to be imposed in each case based on the Council&rsquo;s definitive guidelines. Judges would no longer be distracted by the exercise of navigating the current myriad and overlapping sources of sentencing provisions.\"\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Andrew Caplen, President, The Law Society:<br \/>\r\n                <br \/>\r\n                &ldquo;The current law of sentencing procedure lacks any structural clarity, and is set out in a confusing multitude of sources. Many of these sentencing statutes are themselves only partly in force, whether due to rapid replacement and repeal by yet more legislation or because some provisions are never brought into force, and others overlap considerably in their coverage.<br \/>\r\n                <br \/>\r\n                &ldquo;One result of this unsatisfactory situation is that criminal solicitors, who are under a duty to advise and represent clients during the sentencing process, frequently face an acute challenge in finding, interpreting and advising upon the relevant sentencing provisions. The Law Society therefore firmly supports the Law Commission&rsquo;s project to codify and simplify the law of sentencing procedure, which will bring clear benefits both in terms of increasing efficiency and improving clarity and transparency of the sentencing process for offenders and the general public.&rdquo;\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Alistair MacDonald QC, Chairman, Bar Council:<br \/>\r\n                <br \/>\r\n                &ldquo;Much sentencing legislation has been enacted piecemeal. As a result, it is often complex, obscure and voluminous. In addition, the tendency has been to bring into force sentencing options within the same Act at different times or, in some cases, to bring into force only part of what appeared to be a unified sentencing regime. This places a near impossible burden both on sentencing courts and practitioners, whether defending or prosecuting.<br \/>\r\n                <br \/>\r\n                &ldquo;The Bar Council therefore greatly welcomes the launch of the Law Commission&rsquo;s project to simplify and codify sentencing procedure. The fruits of such a project will be of incalculable help to advocates in carrying out their duty to ensure that the court is accurately informed of the legality of any proposed sentence and the potentially available ancillary orders. It will also help to reduce the workload of the Court of Appeal since it will inevitably result in fewer appeals on technical sentencing points.<br \/>\r\n                <br \/>\r\n                &ldquo;Finally, it will provide greater clarity and comprehensibility to society at large so that the general public will be able more clearly to understand how sentences are determined. Such clarity in relation to sentencing law will help to allay many of the misunderstandings, which have dogged this area of the law.&rdquo;&nbsp;\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions<br \/>\r\n                <br \/>\r\n                &ldquo;For a victim or witness the court process can seem very daunting and people can often be discouraged from being part of proceedings as they are either worried about the length of time it may take or because they do not understand the process they are about to go through.<br \/>\r\n                <br \/>\r\n                &ldquo;Whilst sentencing is only one stage of a trial, it is vital that the public are able to understand the process.

The draft Bill therefore targets Government oversight on key areas where there is sufficient public interest and matters that give rise to questions about the allocation of public resources.

In 2000 the Court of Appeal decided that the forfeiture rule, when applied alongside the rules on intestate succession, disinherits not only the killer, but also the killer&rsquo;s descendants.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              In this project, we considered whether the inheritance rights of descendants should be barred in this way, and reviewed analogous circumstances in inheritance law (both where the deceased dies intestate, and where the estate is inherited under a will) producing similar outcomes. The project did not involve suggesting any changes to the forfeiture rule itself.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              The project\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              This project was referred to us by the Department for Constitutional Affairs, who asked us to review the relationship between the forfeiture and intestacy rules and explore ways in which the law might be reformed to prevent unfairness to potential successors. We were also asked to consider any ancillary areas of succession law that might produce analogous outcomes, for example where a person disclaims (refuses) an inheritance.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              We published our consultation paper (Law Commission Consultation Paper No 172) in October 2003 and received 31 responses.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              On 27 July 2005, we published our report (Law Com No 295). We recommended that where a potential heir is disqualified from inheriting under the forfeiture rule, or has disclaimed an inheritance, the estate should be distributed as if that person had died.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Where the deceased was unlawfully killed and does not leave a will, the killer&rsquo;s share which has been forfeited should pass to the next in line; for example, if a son unlawfully kills his parents, his share in their estates under the intestacy rules should pass to his children, the deceased&rsquo;s grandchildren.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Where a will states that money is left \"to A, but if they should predecease me, to B\", and A forfeits the inheritance, it should pass to B.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>Where a potential heir disclaims an inheritance (either under a will or on intestacy), it should pass to the person who would have received the money had the first heir died.\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The report also recommended removing a small anomaly in intestacy law. If X dies without leaving a will, and an heir such as a child or sibling dies unmarried under the age of 18 but leaves children, the inheritance should pass as though the heir had predeceased X; that is, to the heir&rsquo;s children who could have inherited directly from X.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Implementation\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In 2006 the Government accepted the recommendations made in our report.

The project had originally been proposed by the Department for Transport, which has policy responsibility in this area.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              We published a consultation paper with our provisional proposals for reform on 10 May 2012.&nbsp; We invited responses to our proposals between May and October. We were also assisted by some very helpful discussions with experts in the field, including an advisory group and an expert legal panel on &ldquo;plying for hire&rdquo; (the term &ldquo;plying for hire&rdquo; is one of the core legal concepts used to describe the work undertaken by taxis under current law). In the spring of 2013 we published the responses we received and an interim statement in setting out our key policy conclusions in advance of the final report. We published a final report with our recommendations and draft Bill on 23 May 2014.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              We received over 3000 responses to our consultation, the highest ever number of responses to a Law Commission consultation. We are very grateful for the time and effort that stakeholders have put in to respond to our consultation. The responses are accessible on this project page.&nbsp; We divided the responses into separate bundles, each with an index.&nbsp; We also produced a general index covering all responses.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n              Our recommendations\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We published a report explaining and setting out our recommendations on 23 May 2014, together with a draft Bill. Under current law, separate statutes regulate taxi and private hire vehicles respectively and different legislation applies in London and Plymouth.&nbsp;Our final report and draft Bill set out a new single legal framework for the regulation of taxi and private hire services across England and Wales, including London and Plymouth.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              We recommend retaining the current two-tier system, distinguishing between taxis and private hire vehicles. Only taxis should be allowed to&nbsp;be hailed or pick up passengers from ranks.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The new regime would see the introduction of national standards for all taxis and private hire vehicles, set by the Secretary of State, with the power for local licensing authorities to set additional standards for taxi services only. Local authorities would, however, remain responsible for issuing licences and enforcement in relation to both taxis and private hire vehicles.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              Our recommendations make it easier for providers of private hire services to work cross-border, and give licensing officers new enforcement powers to deal with vehicles and drivers licensed in different areas. We also recommend tougher penalties on touting (actively soliciting customers), including impounding.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              During consultation many stakeholders complained about vehicles operating at the fringes of licensing, or outside licensing altogether. Pedicabs and novelty vehicles, including stretch limousines, are examples that we recommend bringing clearly within the scope of taxi and private hire regulation, such that they may be controlled as necessary.

A large proportion of the victims are among the most vulnerable in society, with housebound and older people facing a particular threat from high-pressure, doorstep selling.&nbsp; Under the existing laws that govern misleading and aggressive practices it is difficult, if not impossible, for consumers to get their money back.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              In May 2008, the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations implemented the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive into UK law.&nbsp;

Other powers were transferred to the Assembly by statute. In 2007, these functions were transferred to Welsh ministers, and provision was made for transferring legislative competence either by statute or by legislative consent order. The system changed in 2011, and the National Assembly now has broader powers to make laws in devolved areas.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              As a result, it can be very difficult to find and understand the law in devolved areas. The problem is particularly acute in respect of executive powers, but is certainly not confined to them. For example, a power which, on the face of a statute, appears to be exercised by the Secretary of State may in fact have been transferred to Welsh ministers. However, this will not be apparent without in-depth research. Pre-devolution statutes may have been subsequently amended, so that they now contain some provisions that cover England and Wales, some that relate to England and some that are specific to Wales only.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              This project will be purely advisory, and our final report will not contain a draft Bill.

Some, but not all, of the recent English legislation is applicable to Wales, while some provisions are specific to Wales only and some have been commenced in England but not in Wales. This means that it is very difficult, even for professionals, to understand which parts of the planning law apply in Wales, leading to increased costs to individuals, communities and businesses, as well as to local planning authorities.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The planning system in England and Wales is based on local development plans.

Where there is no will or a will is invalid, the intestacy rules will apply; they are a blunt instrument that cannot replace the expression of a person&rsquo;s own wishes. Certain individuals and bodies cannot benefit under the rules, including cohabitants and charities. It is therefore important that people make wills and that the law supports this.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              The primary wills statute, the Wills Act 1837, dates from the Victorian era. The law governing testamentary capacity, the mental capacity to make a will, derives from a case from 1870. There is concern that the current law discourages some people from making wills, that it is out of step with social and medical developments, and that it may not work in such a way as to give best effect to a person&rsquo;s intentions on death. It has been criticised for being difficult to understand and apply, and for sometimes being unworkable in practice. In the case of mental capacity, this presents a growing problem, since conditions that affect capacity are becoming more common as people live longer.<br \/>\r\n              <br \/>\r\n              This project will review the law of wills, focusing on four key areas that have been identified as potentially needing reform: testamentary capacity, the formalities for a valid will, the rectification of wills, and mutual wills. It will consider whether the law could be reformed to encourage and facilitate will-making in the 21st century: for example, whether it should be updated to take account of developments in technology and medicine. It will also aim to reduce the likelihood of wills being challenged after death, and the incidence of litigation. Such litigation is expensive, can divide families and is a cause of great stress for the bereaved.<br \/>\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "},{"post_title":"Wildlife","post_content":"\r\n            <p>\r\n              <strong>Status: We published our final report on the control of invasive non-native species&nbsp;on 11 February 2014.

Having analysed the responses, we published our final report, \"In the Public Interest: Publication of Local Authority Reports\" (Law Com 289), together with a draft Bill,&nbsp;in July 2004.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h3>\r\n              Our recommendations\r\n            <\/h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In our report, we made two principal recommendations:\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>a new defence to claims in defamation\r\n              <\/li>\r\n              <li>a new statutory power of inquiry for local authorities\r\n              <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <h3>\r\n              A new defence to claims in defamation\r\n            <\/h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Where a local authority makes public a report of an inquiry into a failure in local authority services, the authority should be able to rely on a new defence to any claim in defamation. But the defence would only be available if either the publishing authority is satisfied that the inquiry and report were fair, or they were in fact fair.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <h3>\r\n              A new statutory power of inquiry for local authorities\r\n            <\/h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The local authority would have the power to establish an inquiry, which could itself apply to the High Court for an order compelling a witness to give evidence. This would achieve a balance between enabling democratically elected bodies to account to their electorate for failures in performance through an effective inquiry, but without putting powers of compulsion in the hands of a non-judicial body.\r\n            <\/p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              &nbsp;\r\n            <\/p>\r\n          "}]
