# Law Commission

## Features

- Dependency management with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
- Enhanced password hashing using bcrypt
- Builds into a docker image
- Docker-compose is used to run as a local development server

## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.1
- Composer - [Install](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)
- Docker & docker-compose - [Install](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)
- Dory (docker proxy for local development) - [Install](https://github.com/FreedomBen/dory)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local machine. Since you'll be using this as a starter for your project, you'll want to delete the `.git` directory.
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/wp-lawcom.git .
    rm -rf .git
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file by copying from `.env.example`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Set the `SERVER_NAME` variable to `lawcom.docker`. This is the hostname that will be used for development on your local machine.

3. Build the project locally. This will install composer dependencies on your local filesystem.
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

    If you experience any errors at this point, it may be due to being unable to access the private composer repository. [More details here](#private-composer-repository).

4. Start the dory proxy, if it's not already running.
    ```bash
    dory up
    ```

    If you get an error message when trying to start dory, make sure you have docker running.

5. Build and run the docker image.
    ```bash
    make run
    ```

6. Once the docker image has built and is running, you should be able to access the running container by going to `http://lawcom.docker/` using your web browser.

    You will need to run through the WordPress installation wizard in your browser.

    The WordPress admin area will be accessible at `http://lawcom.docker/wp/wp-admin`.

## Composer + WordPress plugins

The installation of WordPress core and plugins is managed by composer.

See `composer.json` for the required packages.

Plugins in the [WordPress plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) are available from [WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org/) (wpackagist).

Premium and custom plugins used by MOJ are available in the private composer repository [composer.wp.dsd.io](https://composer.wp.dsd.io).

### WordPress Packagist plugins

Wpackagist plugins are named by their slug on the WordPress plugin repository, prefixed with the vendor `wpackagist-plugin`.

Some examples:
```
| Plugin name | WordPress plugin URL                         | URL slug      | package name                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Akismet     | https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/       | akismet       | wpackagist-plugin/akismet         |
| Hello Dolly | https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/   | hello-dolly   | wpackagist-plugin/hello-dolly     |
| Yoast SEO   | https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/ | wordpress-seo | wpackagist-plugin/wordpress-seo   |
```

#### Example: Installing Akismet plugin

Run the following command:

```
composer require "wpackagist-plugin/akismet" "*"
```

This will install the latest version of [Akismet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/) using the corresponding [wpackagist package](https://wpackagist.org/search?q=akismet).

### Private composer repository

The private composer repository [composer.wp.dsd.io](https://composer.wp.dsd.io) contains premium and custom WordPress plugins.

Access to this repository is restricted. Refer to internal documentation for further details.

### Building theme assets

Theme assets can be built as part of the docker image. Add required commands to `bin/build.sh`.

### Configure the default theme

Set your theme as the default by adding the following line to `config/application.php`:

```php
define('WP_DEFAULT_THEME', 'yourthemename');
```

## WP-CLI

The [WordPress CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) is a useful tool for running commands against your WordPress installation.

To use WP-CLI, your docker container must already be running. (This will probably be running in a separate terminal session/tab.)

1. Run:
    ```bash
    make bash
    ```

    A bash session will be opened in the running container.

2. The WP-CLI will be available as `wp`.

    For example, to list all users in the install:
    ```bash
    wp user list
    ```

## Email delivery

When running locally for development, emails sent by WordPress are not delivered. Instead they are captured by [mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/).

To see emails, go to http://mail.lawcom.docker/ in your browser.
e.g. http://mail.example.docker

This will load a webmail-like interface and display all emails that WordPress has sent.

## Make commands

There are several `make` commands configured in the `Makefile`. These are mostly just convenience wrappers for longer or more complicated commands.
```
| Command      | Descrption                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make build` | Run the build script to install application dependencies and build theme assets. This will typically involve installing composer packages and compiling SASS stylesheets.                            |
| `make clean` | Alias of `git clean -xdf`. Restore the git working copy to its original state. This will remove uncommitted changes and ignored files.                                                               |
| `make run`   | Alias of `docker-compose up`. Launch the application locally using `docker-compose`.                                                                                                                 |
| `make bash`  | Open a bash shell on the WordPress docker container. The [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) is accessible as `wp`. The application must already be running (e.g. via `make run`) before this can be used. |
| `make test`  | Run tests on the application. Out of the box this will run PHP CodeSniffer (code linter).                                                                                                            |
```
